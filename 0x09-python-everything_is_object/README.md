# Python Objects and Concepts


This readme provides an overview of fundamental concepts in Python programming, focusing on objects and related concepts.

## What is an object?
In Python, an object is a self-contained entity that consists of data (properties) and behaviors (methods).
Objects are instances of classes, which act as blueprints for creating objects.

## Class vs. Object/Instance
A class is a template or blueprint that defines the properties and behaviors of objects.
An object, also known as an instance, is a specific realization of a class. 
You can create multiple objects from a single class.

## Mutable vs. Immutable Objects
In Python, objects can be classified as mutable or immutable.
Mutable objects can be modified after creation, while immutable objects cannot be changed once created.

## Reference
A reference is a value that points to an object in memory.
In Python, variables hold references to objects rather than the objects themselves.

## Assignment
Assignment is the process of binding a name (variable) to an object.
When you assign a value to a variable, the variable holds a reference to the assigned object.

## Alias
An alias refers to the situation where two or more variables refer to the same object.
Changes made to one variable will be reflected in the other variables.

## Identical Variables
To check if two variables are identical (refer to the same object), you can use the `is` operator.

## Same Object
To determine if two variables are linked to the same object, you can use the `==` operator for object equality.

## Displaying Variable Identifier
In Python, you can display the variable identifier, which represents the memory address of the object in the CPython
implementation, using the `id()` function.

## Mutable and Immutable Objects
Mutable objects can be modified after creation, while immutable objects cannot be changed.
Immutable objects are safer for sharing between different parts of a program.

## Built-in Mutable Types
Some built-in mutable types in Python include lists, dictionaries, and sets.
These types allow modifications to their contents after creation.

## Built-in Immutable Types
Python provides several built-in immutable types, such as integers, floats, strings, tuples, and frozensets.
Once created, these objects cannot be modified.

## Variable Passing to Functions
In Python, variables are passed to functions by reference.
This means that the function receives a reference to the object, allowing the function to modify mutable objects.
However, immutable objects passed to functions cannot be modified within the function.

Understanding these concepts will help you write effective and reliable Python code.
Explore further and leverage the power of objects and their behaviors to build robust applications.
