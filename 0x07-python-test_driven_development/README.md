Test-driven Development (TDD) in Python

Overview

This repository provides an introduction to Test-driven Development (TDD) in Python. 
Test-driven Development is a software development approach that emphasizes writing tests
before implementing the actual code. By following this approach, developers can ensure the
reliability and correctness of their code.

Getting Started

To get started with Test-driven Development in Python, follow these steps:

Clone this repository to your local machine.
Ensure you have Python installed on your system (version X.X.X or higher).
Install the necessary dependencies by running pip install -r requirements.txt.
Open a terminal and navigate to the repository's directory.

Writing Tests

To practice Test-driven Development in Python, follow these guidelines:

Create a new test file in the tests/ directory for each module or component you want to test.
Import the necessary modules and functions required for testing.
Define test cases using functions with a name starting with test_.
Within each test case, use assertions to verify the expected behavior of the code.
Run the test suite using a testing framework such as unittest or pytest to execute the tests and check for failures.
Implement the code to fulfill the requirements of the test cases.
Repeat steps 3-6 until all test cases pass and the desired functionality is achieved.

Running Tests
To run the test suite, execute the following command in the terminal:

python test_example.py

Contributing

Contributions to this repository are always welcome.
If you find any issues or have suggestions for improvements,
please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.

When contributing, please ensure that:

Your code follows the PEP 8 style guide.

You include tests to cover the new functionality or changes you introduce.

The existing test suite passes successfully.

Your code is well-documented and includes necessary comments where appropriate.
