0x05. Python - Exceptions


Exceptions are a way to handle and respond to exceptional or unexpected
situations that occur during the execution of a program.

They allow you to gracefully handle errors, abnormal conditions, or other
 exceptional events that might disrupt the normal flow of your code.

The purpose of catching exceptions is to provide an opportunity to gracefully
handle errors and prevent your program from crashing.

By catching exceptions, you can display error messages to the user,
perform alternative actions, or take corrective measures. 

It helps in maintaining the stability and reliability of your program.
