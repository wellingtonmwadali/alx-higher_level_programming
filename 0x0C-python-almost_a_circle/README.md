Unit Testing
Unit testing is a software testing technique that allows you to validate individual components or units of code in isolation. It ensures that each unit functions correctly and meets the specified requirements. Implementing unit testing in a large project offers several benefits, including early bug detection and maintenance of code stability.

To implement unit testing in a large project, you can follow these steps:

Choose a suitable unit testing framework for your Python project, such as pytest.
Create separate test cases for each unit of code you want to test.
Write test functions that exercise the code under specific conditions and check for expected outcomes.
Organize your test cases into test suites based on functionality or modules.
Utilize a continuous integration system to automatically run the tests whenever there are code changes.
Execute the tests regularly to ensure the stability and reliability of the codebase.
Serialization and Deserialization of a Class
Serialization is the process of converting an object's state into a format that can be stored or transmitted, while deserialization is the reverse process of restoring the object from its serialized form.

args: Variable Number of Positional Arguments
In Python, *args is used to pass a variable number of non-keyworded arguments to a function. It allows you to pass an arbitrary number of positional arguments as a tuple

**kwargs: Variable Number of Keyword Arguments
In Python, **kwargs allows you to pass a variable number of keyword arguments to a function. It enables you to pass named arguments as a dictionary.

Handling Named Arguments in a Function
To handle named arguments in a function, define the function with explicit parameter names and assign default values to some or all of the parameters. This allows callers to specify values for specific named parameters while still providing default values for the rest.
