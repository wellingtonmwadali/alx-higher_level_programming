0x06. Python - Classes and Objects


In Python, classes and objects are fundamental concepts of object-oriented programming.
 A class is a blueprint for creating objects, while an object is an instance of a class.
Classes define the properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods) that objects of that class will have.
