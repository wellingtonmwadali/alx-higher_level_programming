Python - More Classes and Objects

This directory contains the solutions to the tasks related to "More Classes and Objects" in
the Python programming language. Each task is implemented in a separate Python file with a
corresponding name.

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that organizes code into objects,
which represent real-world entities, and provides a way to structure and design applications.
Python is an object-oriented programming language, and understanding OOP concepts is crucial
for effective Python programming.

Classes and Objects

A class is a blueprint for creating objects.
It defines the attributes (data) and methods (functions) that objects of the class will have.
An object is an instance of a class, created using the class definition.

Attributes

In Python, attributes are variables that belong to an object or class.
They store data that describes the state of the object.
Attributes can be accessed and modified using dot notation (object.attribute or class.attribute).

Public, Protected, and Private Attributes

Python does not provide explicit access modifiers like some other languages. 
By convention, attributes starting with an underscore (_) are considered protected,
indicating that they should not be accessed outside the class. Attributes starting 
with two underscores (__) are considered private, and their names are "mangled" to
prevent accidental access. However, it is still possible to access and modify these attributes, although it is discouraged.

The self Keyword

In Python, the self keyword is used as the first parameter in method definitions within a class.
It refers to the instance of the class and allows accessing the object's attributes and methods.

Methods

Methods are functions defined within a class that perform operations on objects of that class.
They can access and modify the object's attributes and perform specific actions.

The __init__ Method

The __init__ method is a special method in Python classes that is called automatically
when an object is created from a class. It is used to initialize the object's attributes and perform any necessary setup.

Data Abstraction, Data Encapsulation, and Information Hiding

Data abstraction is the concept of representing essential features of an object while hiding its internal details.
Data encapsulation is the process of combining data and methods within a class to provide abstraction.
Information hiding is an important principle of OOP, which restricts direct access to object data and allows access only through methods.

Properties
Properties in Python are a way to add computed attributes or calculated values to objects.
They are defined using the @property decorator and provide getter and setter methods to control access and modification of the attribute.

Attribute vs Property

An attribute is a data item that belongs to an object or class, while a property is a special kind
of attribute that provides controlled access and modification through getter and setter methods.

Getters and Setters

Getters and setters are methods used to retrieve and modify the values of attributes in a controlled manner.
They provide an interface to access and modify attributes while ensuring data encapsulation and maintaining the integrity of the object.

The __str__ and __repr__ Methods

The __str__ and __repr__ methods are special methods in Python classes that provide string representations of objects. 
The __str__ method returns a user-friendly string representation, 
while the __repr__ method returns a string representation that is more suitable for debugging and development purposes.

Class Attributes

Class attributes are attributes that are shared among all instances of a class.
They are defined outside any method in a class and are accessed using the class name or an instance of the class.

Object Attributes vs Class Attributes
Object attributes are specific to each instance of a class and are defined within methods or the __init__ method.
They represent the unique state of each object. Class attributes, on the other hand, are shared among all instances
of a class and represent properties that are common to all objects of that class.

Class Methods

Class methods are methods that are bound to the class and not the instance of the class.
They can be called on the class itself without creating an object. Class methods are defined using the @classmethod decorator.

Static Methods
Static methods are methods that do not have access to the instance or class.
They are independent of the object or class and can be called on the class itself. Static methods are defined using the @staticmethod decorator.

Dynamic Creation of Attributes

In Python, attributes can be dynamically created for existing instances of a class by assigning 
a value to a new attribute name. This allows flexibility in adding attributes as needed during runtime.

Binding Attributes

Attributes can be bound to both objects and classes in Python.
Bound attributes are accessed using dot notation and can be either data attributes or methods.

The __dict__ Attribute

The __dict__ attribute is a dictionary that contains the attributes (both data attributes and methods) of
an object or a class. It provides a way to access and manipulate the attributes dynamically.

Finding Attributes

Python follows a specific order to find attributes. 
It first checks if the attribute exists in the object's namespace, then in the class namespace, and finally in the parent classes and their namespaces.

Using the getattr Function

The getattr function is a built-in Python function used to retrieve the value of an attribute from an object dynamically.
It takes the object and attribute name as parameters and returns the value if the attribute exists.
